# Capstone_2_Forecast_webpage_visits
This project uses Wikipedia page visits data from a Kaggle competition to forecast. The main goal of this project is to get familiar with various time series forecast methods. Here three approaches were tested: ARIMA, Prophet and LSTM. 
The project was developed in Google Colab to utilize the GPU it provides and make the computation more efficient.
