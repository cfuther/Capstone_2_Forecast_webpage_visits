# Capstone_2_Forecast_webpage_visits
This project works on time series forecast using page visits data of approximately 145000 Wikipedia articles. The main goal of this project is to get familiar with various time series forecast methods. Here three approaches were tested: ARIMA, Prophet and LSTM. Their performance was evaluated using SMAPE and forecast patterns were compared with series of train and test period.    
The project was developed in Google Colab to utilize the GPU it provides and make the computation more efficient. Three files are included here:    
web_traffic_prediction.ipynb: ipython script including data wrangling, exploration, and modeling   
Capstone Project 2 Report.pdf: full report including background introduction, data exploration, modeling and summary   
Web Traffic Forecast.pdf: slides to highlight the main results
